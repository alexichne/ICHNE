# ICHNE

The following R scripts were used for data analysis at the Newcastle Lighthouse Lab, and run nightly.

sanger.R - This script took LIMS data and Hamilton liquid handler output files to generate plate map files in the format requested by the Wellcome Sanger Institute.  It also generated two reports requested by the UKHSA: a daily summary of Reflex Assay results, and a weekly list of all samples that were voided, as well as metadata.

KPI.r - This script built a dataset from LIMS and instrument data from the previous 3 days, and carried out calculations and statistical analysis.  It called several R Markdown scripts which generated reports:  a KPI report for the previous 24 hours (KPI_report_Z.Rmd), two KPI reports for the previous two 12 hour shifts (8-to-8.Rmd), and heatmaps showing the physical locations of positive and inconclusive tests on each instrument (heatmaps.Rmd).

email_KPI.R - this script emailed the reports generated by KPI.r to the intended recipients

The remaining scripts were used as needed:

innovation.R - Created a report with requested metadata for samples that were sent to the Innovation Lab.

CT_histos.Rmd - produced a report with histograms showing Ct distribution across samples.
